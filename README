Improvements by Fabrice FACORAT 20110914

Perform a binary search through a log file to find a range of times
and print the corresponding lines
Log file date time format at the beginning of the line :
YYYY-mm-dd HH:MM:SS <log content>

tested with Python 2.6

TODO: Make sure that it works if the seek falls in the middle of
      the first or last line
TODO: Make sure it's not blind to a line where the sync read falls
      exactly at the beginning of the line being searched for and
      then gets skipped by the second read
DONE: Support more log time format
TODO: Support case when log files may not be properly sorted ( remove superfluous lines )
